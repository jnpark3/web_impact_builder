## About the project

The Web Impact Builder provides users with an intuitive no-code interface to create websites effortlessly. Users can begin by creating an account and logging in using a comprehensive authentication system. On the dashboard, users can quickly create a new website and enter the website creator environment. Here, they will find a drag-and-drop interface that allows them to add, remove, and reorder website building blocks on a canvas. Users can edit the content of each block, such as text, images, videos, surveys, and donation acceptors, by clicking on the corresponding block. Once the website is complete, users can preview it on their browser or export the code. With the exported code, users can deploy their website on web hosting services without having to rely on expensive website builders like Wix.

## Inspiration

Over the past five years, we (Jian & Jenny) have both participated in and led several volunteering and charity organizations. However, we have consistently faced challenges with website construction resources available for non-profits. While platforms such as Wix and Wordpress offer users the ability to create comprehensive websites with no-code interfaces, they often restrict critical features behind expensive subscription tiers. Non-profits require premium features like accepting donations and unrestricted surveys, which are necessary for their operations. Additionally, many features offered by these platforms are irrelevant to the needs of non-profits. As a result, we recognized the need for a customized website builder that caters specifically to non-profit organizations at an affordable price.
